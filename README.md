# usingarithmeticoper

using arithmetic operators...
this exemple demostrates how mathematical operatos are used with numbers to calculate the
combined values of two cost

the fist couple of lines create
two variable: one to store the subtotal of the order ,the other to hold the cost of shipping
the order;so the variable are named accordingly:subtotal end shipping

on the third line,the total is calculated by adding together these two values

this demostrates how the mathtematical operators can use variables that represent numbers. (that is,the numbers do not need to be written explicity into the code ..)

the remaining six lines of code write the results to the screen
